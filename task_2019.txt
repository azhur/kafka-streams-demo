1. Create iot_usage_records topic that will contain json records with next structure:
 - id:uuid
 - device_sn: String // device serial number
 - download_bytes:Long
 - upload_bytes:Long
 - session_start_time:Long(epoch millis) // the timestamp of the network session start
 The iot device publish network usage in realtime to that topic. (You can have a script that emulates that)

2. Create iot_devices topic that will contain json records with next structure:
 - id:uuid
 - serial_number:string
 - account_sn:string // account serial number
This is a topic that persists iot devices forever.
In reality the producer could be a kafka-connector that dumps data from the Database.
(You can have a script that loads a set of devices to iot_devices topic).

3. Write a kafka-streams app that aggregates total download_bytes and total upload_bytes
per account in a 1 minute window and publishes the aggregated usage to iot_aggregated_usage topic.
Usage records that don't belong to a valid device from iot_devices topic should be skipped.
Use WallclockTimestampExtractor (default) as a timestamp for windowing.
The record json format:
 - account_sn: String
 - period_start: String (Window start)
 - period_end: String (Window end)
 - download_bytes:Long
 - upload_bytes:Long

4. (Optional) Write unit tests using https://kafka.apache.org/23/documentation/streams/developer-guide/testing.html.
